## Supervised Learning

The code is divided in two Jupyter notebooks:
- `01_Regression/01_Regression.ipynb` for the **regression** task
- `02_Classification/02_Classification.ipynb` for the **classification** task

Functions are divided into several `.py` files, which are imported in the `.ipynb` notebook. A `README.md` file in each folder explains the file structure.
